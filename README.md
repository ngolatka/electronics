# What's this about
This is a collection of schematics and technical descriptions of various
electronic circuits, mostly on hobbyist / DIY level.

Unless otherwise noted, circuits are designed by [ngolatka](https://github.com/ngolatka).

# Disclaimer
Use everything at your own risk, especially mains powered / high voltage
stuff (110/230V).

As a rule of thumb, if you are not sure if something might be dangerous,
don't mess around with it - and if you *are* sure, be careful anyway.
